# flchain
**flchain** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli).

## Get started

```
ignite chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure# FL-Chain

A Cosmos SDK-based blockchain implementing flash loan functionality.

## Overview
FL-Chain is a blockchain module that enables flash loan capabilities, allowing users to borrow assets temporarily within a single transaction.

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.18+
- Cosmos SDK v0.50.9
- Make

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaushik-i-b/fl-chain
cd fl-chain
make install

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com).

### Web Frontend

Additionally, Ignite CLI offers both Vue and React options for frontend scaffolding:

For a Vue frontend, use: `ignite scaffold vue`
For a React frontend, use: `ignite scaffold react`
These commands can be run within your scaffolded blockchain project. 


For more information see the [monorepo for Ignite front-end development](https://github.com/ignite/web).

## Release
To release a new version of your blockchain, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.

### Install
To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/kaushik-i-b/fl-chain@latest! | sudo bash
```
`kaushik-i-b/fl-chain` should match the `username` and `repo_name` of the Github repository to which the source code was pushed. Learn more about [the install process](https://github.com/allinbits/starport-installer).
